# Code-Journey_with_Java🧑🏻‍💻

This repository is our one-stop shop for mastering the art of coding in Java, equipped with the power of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

<hr/>

## How much Java do I need to learn for Android development🫨❔

1] Variables &nbsp;&nbsp;2] Loops &nbsp;&nbsp;3] Conditionals &nbsp;&nbsp;4} Logical/Relaion Operator &nbsp;&nbsp;5] Exeptional Handling &nbsp;&nbsp;6] Function &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>
7] Classes & Inheritance &nbsp;&nbsp;8] Collection Framework &nbsp;&nbsp; 9] Thread & Libraries &nbsp;&nbsp;10] OOPs Concept

## What you'll find inside:

i] Solid Java Foundation: Build a strong understanding of Java syntax, control flow, object-oriented programming principles (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism), and exception handling.

ii] Data Structures Demystified: Explore core data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs with clear explanations, code implementations, and practical applications.

iii] Algorithm Boot Camp: Master fundamental algorithms like searching, sorting, recursion, dynamic programming, and graph traversal through interactive exercises and problem-solving techniques.

iv] Real-world Application: See how DSA concepts come to life by tackling practical coding challenges and projects that solidify your learning.

## This repository is ideal for:
~Beginners with no prior programming experience seeking a structured introduction to Java and DSA.

~Programmers looking to refresh their Java skills and delve deeper into DSA concepts.

~Anyone passionate about problem-solving and building efficient solutions using code.
